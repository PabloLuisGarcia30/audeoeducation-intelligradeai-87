  skillName: string,
  subject: string,
  grade: string,
  difficulty: string
): string {
  return `Generate ${difficulty} level multiple-choice questions for ${grade} ${subject}, focusing on the skill: "${skillName}".

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: For each multiple-choice question, create distractors that represent SPECIFIC, COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS students have with this skill.

For each incorrect option (A, B, C, D - excluding the correct answer), you MUST:
1. Base the distractor on a real misconception students commonly have
2. Provide a clear misconception description 
3. Map to one of these misconception categories:
   - Procedural Errors (step omission, order errors, symbol confusion)
   - Conceptual Errors (false assumptions, overgeneralization, model misuse)
   - Interpretive Errors (keyword confusion, task misread, literal interpretation)
   - Expression Errors (vocabulary mismatch, poor organization)
   - Strategic Errors (wrong approach, off-topic response)
   - Meta-Cognitive Errors (overconfidence, ignoring feedback)
